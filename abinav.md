Vanakam(Greetings in tamil) all!!
I am Abinav of CSE-B.
I am from Tamil Nadu.
I am a linux enthusiast.
I do have knowledge on programming . I have learnt C++(Hopefully I remeber), Python and currently learning Golang. But, my logical part needs working though. 
I have also written a bash script and hence I do have some knowledge on bash scripting.

I do know git for version control ofcourse.
I go with the philosophy of open source.
I wish to know the engineering part of everything that I use, apart from the end user part.
I am interested in flute( I have started learning but I need a tutor) and I am good at volley ball and table tennis.
It is like more of what I know than a self-intro.
I use arch btw.
