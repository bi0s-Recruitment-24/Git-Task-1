Hi there! I am Devanandan N. B. I am from Thiruvananthapuram. I am a guy who started with foss and linux when my father bought me a raspberry pi in 10th. From there I tried things, explored, failed, resolved and repeated to where I am. I am very interested in this stuff. I hope this passion of mine comes to fruiton atleast in bi0s
