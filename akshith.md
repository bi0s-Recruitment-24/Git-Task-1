I am Akshith Manoj, a dude who is really passionate about cybersecurity and it's applications. I love solving complex problems and thinking out of the box. From a very young age, my dad was
my inspiration to pursue Cybersecurity, as he himself is a Cybersecurity expert. I may be new to all of these different programming languages, linux and git, but a quality that I believe
I have is that, I learn pretty quickly and I just love challenging environments. I have the drive to continually upskill myself in this never ending field of tech and wonder and I think 
that there isn't a better choice than Bi0s's CTF team for me to do that. I have prior experience competing with and against the best in an International Spelling Bee at Ethiopia, 
which I think has helped me a ton by making me handle heavily pressurized situations with a calm and composed demeanor, and I think competitions like these will make one really ready
for the REAL WORLD and the extreme competition out there! I really dont't want to brag but I will, I managed to secure a position in the top 10 of the whole country. I really, really do
hope to learn and upskill from you guys soon!
