Hi, I'm Rohan, currently studying in B.Tech CSE, who loves to manage people, solve problems, and most importantly learn.

I enjoy problem-solving and would love to apply this skill to solve real world relevant problems.

These kind of challenges is what keeps me excited and keeps the motivation up.

I plan on working harder and learning more to achieve the required skill set to set foot onto the next level.
