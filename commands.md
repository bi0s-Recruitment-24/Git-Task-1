1. "git clone <ssh link>" -which clones the repo. 

First I wrote the text file using vim.

2. "git add --all" - which will stage(index) all file which have been changed. 

3. "git commit -m "some message"" - this command is used to commit the changes done to the file. 

4. "git checkout -b abinav" - This command creates a branch named abinav and switches to it. It can also be done using separate commands for creating the branch and switching to it.

5. "git checkout main" to main branch for mearging.

6. "git merge abinav" for merging the branch named abinav with the main branch.

7. Then did "git add" and "git commit" after editing the README.md file.

8. "git reset --hard HEAD~1" - This command reverts the recent commit and also erases the commit history.

9. Finally "git push" for pushing the changes to the remote server.
