For fork and clone git clone command is used which copied the repository to local and cd was used to keep the repository in the folder here Git-task-1.The textfile was declared and created using echo-a shell command with extension .txt, git add was used to make sure changes are saved git commit -m comments command was used to add snapshot with a brief explanation as to what the snapshot means. git checkpoint -b shagun was used to create and check out the new branch shagun. Again using echo a markdown file was created with the extension .md, git add was used to save changes, git commit -m to save snapshot. git log --n1 was used to access the commit hash of the last commit of the markdown file here n1 specifically allows to access the last commit's commit hash. Then echo was used to add it along with >> double arrows which means to append the file from the last and then again git add and git commit -m was used to make the changes permanent and create snapshots. git checkpoint main was used to check on main from shagun and then git merge shagun was used to transfer everything in to to main branch. Using echo my name was added in README.md file, git add and git commit -m was used to make the changes permanent. And to reset the very action of file commiting git reset --soft HEAD~1 was used soft basically allows undoing a commit and HEAD~1 makes sure its the last commit that is undo.
